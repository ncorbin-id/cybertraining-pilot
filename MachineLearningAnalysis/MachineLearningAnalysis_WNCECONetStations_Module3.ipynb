    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific research rarely yields a simple and straightforward right answer. Instead, scientists analyze evidence, compare it to known physical processes, and make informed recommendations based on data and statistics. As you learned in *Machine Learning Foundations in the Earth System Sciences*, machine learning is not an exact science, rather, it generates approximations from large datasets. This makes evaluating model quality complex. What one scientist considers a high-performing model may be insufficient to another. What matters most is your ability to justify your results within the context of physical science and the real-world stakes. As you continue your studies, remember that these models are not just numbers. They are representations of the physical world."
